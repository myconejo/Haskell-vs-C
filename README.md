- `DLL.hs`  Linked List implemented with Haskell (Purely Functional)

## Binary Search Tree (BST)
- `tree.c`  BST implemented with C
- `tree.cpp`BST implemented with C++ (Object Oriented)
- `tree.py` BST implemented with Python (Object Oriented)
- `tree.hs` BST implemented with Haskell (Purely Functional)

## Sort
- `sort.cpp`  Sorting algorithms in C++ (Object Oriented)
- `sort.hs`   Sorting algorithms in Haskell (Purely Functional)

## Hash
- `hash.cpp`  Double Hashing and Separate Chaining in C++ (Object Oriented)
